I am a Data Analyst / Python developer and I love programming and data management 💻. I studied a bootcamp and soon after I was the teacher 🤓. I'm a musician 🎸, I like scuba diving 🤿, travelling by van 🚘 and being with my greyhound 🐕. I have a colourful brain 🧠 and a lot of energy.
I'm very creative and I have a project on neural networks and abstract art. I'm always on the rocket 🚀
